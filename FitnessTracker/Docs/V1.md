# WorkoutTracker v1

This v1 is generated from:
- `Design_Philosophy.md`
- `Plan.md`
- `Architecture_Constitution.md`

## What is implemented
- Local-first SwiftData model layer for workouts, splits, muscle groups, muscle regions, exercises, and sets.
- Split-aware binary muscle coverage engine (`CoverageEngine`).
- Stats and weekly-goal engines (`StatsEngine`, `WeeklyGoalEngine`).
- JSON export/import with `schemaVersion` (`ExportImportService`).
- First-launch bootstrap for default taxonomy and default split presets (`BootstrapService`).
- First-launch exercise seed import from bundled JSON (`SeedDataService`).
- SwiftUI feature shell:
  - Train tab with live coverage card
  - History tab with session list
  - Progress tab with volume chart
  - Settings tab with theme mode control

## Folder structure
- `FitnessTracker/Models`
- `FitnessTracker/Services`
- `FitnessTracker/Features`
- `FitnessTracker/UIComponents`
- `FitnessTracker/Settings`
- `FitnessTracker/Resources`
- `FitnessTracker/Docs`

## Notes
- Theme integration is routed through `ThemeManager` and includes a `canImport(DesignKit)` branch.
- Replace `Theme.shared.colors.*` calls in `ThemeManager` with exact DesignKit API names if they differ.
- No hard-coded RGB/hex color values are used in app UI.

## Next cut candidates
1. Wire exercise-to-region maps during seed import.
2. Add session detail sheet with touched/missed region checklist.
3. Expand tests for coverage report scenarios and export/import roundtrip.
